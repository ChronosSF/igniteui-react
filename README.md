These components will enable you to use Ignite UI controls in React applicaitons.

Currently the first preview version is under construction. We hope to release these great components on October 24th to coincide with the launch of version 16.2 of our control suite. 

Until that time, feel fee to learn more about [Ignite UI](http://www.igniteui.com) and checkout our [Angular 2.0 components](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular2). We also offer [Zero Blocks](https://github.com/Infragistics/zero-blocks), which are moble-first, touch-first native Angular 2.0 components designed for mobile web applications.
