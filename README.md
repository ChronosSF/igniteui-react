Use the declarations available in `igniteui-react.js` (or `igniteui-react.min.js`) to use [Ignite UI](http://igniteui.com) controls as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components. [Work with the running samples here](https://igniteui.github.io/igniteui-react/).

# Requirements

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.9 and later
- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 15.3.2 and later
- [Ignite UI](http://www.igniteui.com) 16.1 and later
- [Babel-Core](https://babeljs.io/) 5.8.38 and later for optional [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) support

# Install

You can install the package with `npm`.

```shell
npm install igniteui-react
```

# Building

and then minify it producing `dist/npm/igniteui-react.min.js` 

To build the project use the following steps:

1. Open a console in the folder where the **igniteui-react** project is located
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run build`
